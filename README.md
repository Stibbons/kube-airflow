# Airflow Helm Chart

This Repository is **OBSOLETE**. It has been started as a fork of
[mumoshu/kube-airflow](https://github.com/mumoshu/kube-airflow) and implementing a Kubernetes Helm 
Chart. It is now time to move to the official chart repository.

Main development now occurs on the Pull Request for the airflow charts at:
[gsemet/charts@airflow](https://github.com/gsemet/charts/tree/airflow/incubator/airflow).

The old content was backed up on the
[obsolete_chart branch](https://github.com/gsemet/kube-airflow/tree/obsolete_chart)
